# What I Learned?

I learned the role of Gradle in building Android Apps and how to use
Gradle to manage apps of increasing complexity. Also:

* Added free and paid flavors to an app, and set up build to share code between them
* Factor reusable functionality into a Java library
* Factor reusable Android functionality into an Android library
* Configure a multi project build to compile my libraries and app
* Use the Gradle App Engine plugin to deploy a backend
* Configure an integration test suite that runs against the local App Engine development server
